## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. If you don't have it already installed, install pygame in the project's working directory via pip.
2. Make sure to have 'main.py' open, otherwise it won't run.
3. Run the program.

Instructions for using the software:

1. To move / change direction, use W/A/S/D to move Up/Left/Down/Right. To burst, press E.
2. When bursting, your length and score will decrease. Be careful!
3. To gain score, move your dragon to get points that spawn randomly, or points from dead enemies.
4. Don't run into enemy dragons, obstacles, or the border otherwise you will die. You can then respawn with R, or quit with Q.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* You need Python v 3.13 (most recent stable ver.), Pip, Pygame, and VS Code.
* With a working Python version, use pip to install Pygame with "pip install pygame" in a new terminal for your current project's working directory

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I plan to develop better styling for this. Dragons will look like dragons, with wings cosmetically.
* [ ] Dragons will gain powerups that spawn across the map. Use these to get ahead of the rest, when I add them.
* [ ] Dragons will have signature moves that can be exchanged for points. Dragon selection will be possible, and other dragons will be randomized among the selection of other dragon types.
* [ ] Different levels of difficulty will be added, such as easier enemy AI, impossibly difficult enemy AI, etc.
* [ ] Challenges will be added, such as timed challenges, endurance challenges, and more.
